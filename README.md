## 🚀 Little story behind my project
Hi,
I am Aman somewhere between ''full stack developer'' means still not in working phase.
This is my final year project .
How i made it?
Well, As every final year student have to make a project so it was the same.But the project idea evolved with time 

- In the starting I was making e-commerce website like any other student
- Then I somehow thougth that if i add something in this website it will be diffrent from any other student project 
- So I merged another project in it a social platform
- From then it became Book Store to Social Book Store(Whizzy)  

- Story Ends and college life too😒
